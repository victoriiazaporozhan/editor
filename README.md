# Website Editor





## Instructions
Welcome to the Website Editor Code Exam! 👾

In this assignment, you’ll be creating a simple website editor shown in the video below. This repo includes a static version of the editor with all its elements, states, and styles. Your task is to make it interactive. There’s no need to integrate with a backend.

[▶️ Video Example](./public/editor-demo.mp4)

## Getting Started
- make sure you use Node v14+
- `npm install`
- `npm start` and wait for the Gallery page to open in Chrome

## Submission
- The target of your bundle/project should be the `build` folder in the root of the repo.
- Once you are ready please create a Pull Request against master including all your changes.
- Send the link in response to the initial email with a task. Please specify in the email how long the task took to complete.


## Steps

We advise you to approach the task in the following order:

1. Decide how you’re going to represent the data.
2. Render the grid with a few text blocks.
3. Allow selecting rows and columns.
4. Display sidebar sections for the selected item.
5. Allow adding rows, columns, and text.
6. Bonus: allow changing text alignment, add support for images, and store the data in localStorage or IndexedDB, so it’s not lost on page refresh.

## Notes

- Refer to the video as to how things should work.
- It’s ok if you don’t finish everything. We mainly want to see how you divide the problem into parts and define interactions between them. Are control flow and data flow easy to follow? Is naming clear? Does your code make it easy to add new features, such as the ability to delete rows or change their order?
- Feel free to add libraries and change any files you want. Don’t be limited by the current project structure or existing components.
- Note that the code quality is more important than simply passing the step. Do your best to make the implementation clean, modular, well organized, and easy to understand.
- Don’t worry about performance optimization.
- You probably won’t need to change CSS, since all necessary CSS classes and styles are already included.
- If at any point something is unclear you may contact your interviewer.
- Good luck! ✌️
